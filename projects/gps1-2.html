                    <p>Pair Programming is a great way for programmers to put their minds together and collaberate on a variety of projects, challenges, and so forth. When programming alone, everyone has weak points.                         However pair programming allows you to come together and utilize each others strengths, to come up                       with the best version.

                    <h4>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h4>

                    <p> Pair programming is important to DBC, because it allows you to get comfortable working with others. Also taking on different roles allows you to step back and see how another person tackles a challenge and compare it with how you would have done it. All in all, it is also a great learning experience, because every pair programming session, you tend to learn something new from your peer.

                    <p>While Comparing 'Driver' and 'Navigator: One must take a few things into consideration. Firstly, I will address the 'Driver' Role. As a "Driver" the pair is responsible for physically entering the code, and implementing syntax. This person is also in charge of where the team goes, as far as deciding whether to implement an 'array' or maybe decides a 'hash' would be more appropriate. While in the Navigator role, the pair must take the big picture into consideration, and ensure the 'Driver' isnt headed down any "Rabit-Holes". The Navigator is responsible for interpreting the objective and "Navigating" the pair through the challenge in an efficient and focused manner.</p>

                    <h4>Best Practices while Pair Programming</h4>

                    <p>Pair Programming can be an extremly rewarding, and enjoyable experience. As long as both people involed are courteous of the other pair. We have designed a short summary of "Best Practices" to incorporate into your next pairing session. First, understand you pair is infact not a computer, do not be afraid to ask "how is your day going" or "How are you feeling regarding a certain task/challenge", do not be afraid to humanize the experience. Second, it is the responsibility of each person in the group to contribute, and give their pair the opportuinity to contribute, noone likes a ball-hog, but noone likes a mooch either. Lastly, Enjoy the Session! This should be a fun and rewarding experience. Treat it as such!</p>

                    <h4>Reflection</h4>
                    <p>Peer Programming is a rewarding experience. It allows both the driver and navigator the opportunity to collaborate on best practices. As a pair we were able to leverage each other's strengths to maximize the clarity of material. A strong line of communication kept us on track. It is not best practice to add CSS to the html framework. Seperating the structuring and styling helps the developer stay organized. Additionally, by using a seperate stylesheet document, the developer/team are able to apply the styling format across multiple pages within a website. If the styling is embedded within the structure of the HTML page it will prevent the developer from easily applying their stylesheets to more than one page in a website DOM.
