				<h3>Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects</h3>
				<h4>by Randy Grewal on December 14, 2014</h4>

				<div id="bodyp"><p>I have spent the past for weeks learning Ruby and the couple weeks before that were spent on HTML and CSS. The order we were taught each langauage was set up to sort of ease us into programming and everything is supposed to get harder as we progress. The first two weeks of Ruby were the hardest for me because the concepts were relatively new and it was kind of hard to get a hang of. By week four of Ruby I felt pretty confident with my Ruby abilities and I felt that I could tackle any challenge thrown my way.
				<br>
				<br>
				This week when we jumped into JavaScript I was a little nervous but at the same time excited to learn a new language. I was suprised to find that JavaScript was relatively easy for me to understand. I guess spending that much time learning Ruby taught me how to correctly learn a language and know what to look for. When I looked at JavaScript for the first time I immediately started to notice the similarities and differences between it and Ruby. Having that comparison baseline helped me mentally map out JavaScipt.
				<br>
				<br>
				I noticed a couple things but what stood out the most to me was the similarity between Ruby Hashes and JavaScript Objects. I was pretty comfortable with Hashes in Ruby and it turns out that JavaScripts are almost the same thing, but they are even easier to manipulate. As shown in the image above, creating a new Hash in Ruby is almost exactly the same technique as creating a new object and adding a property in JavaScript. In order to create a new key-value pair in Ruby there is only one way to go about it and that is shown on line 3. However, in JavaScript, there are several ways to add, change, and display object properties as shown on lines 3 through 6. Another similarities between JavaScript objects and Ruby I noticed is editing object properties. On line 3 you may notice that I am adding a property to the (obj) object called age with a value of 22. This is very similar to giving a Ruby Class variable an attr_accessor ability. I've found that comparing and contrasting languages is the best and quickest way to learn new languages. I am only 1 week into JavaScript and I feel incredibly confident in my ability to tackle challenges in the coming weeks.
