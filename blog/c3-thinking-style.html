				<h3>My Thinking Style: How my Mind Works</h3>
				<h4>by Randy Grewal on November 13, 2014</h4>

				<div id="bodyp"><p>My <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinking Style</a> is categorized as Abstract Random. I think it is quite accurate in describing how my mind works and how I learn best. I have always thought of myself as a very abstract thinker. I can imagine and visualize things pretty clearly but that sometimes causes me to get ahead of myself. I absorb material pretty quickly and as a result I start looking for answers to questions that I do not need to know just yet. This goes hand in hand with my Random thinking style. I sometimes overlook important aspects of information I have recieved, but this has made me into a quite flexible learner. I am very spontaneous because my mind starts to wander in every which way; this more often than not makes it hard for me to focus on the task at hand. I love to learn things from my peers because to be completely honest, reading is pretty boring. This has allowed me to get very comfortable with interaction and consequently, I am an extremely outgoing person. I am a friendly person, but it is hard for me to work with people who are too bossy or that just don't seem very friendly. It is always hard for me to get things started because I brainstorm too much, but once I do get started, it's quite hard for me to stop until I feel what I have done is perfect.
				<br>
				<br>
				So far, I think Phase 0 has been very interesting and I have learned a lot from the challenges as well as my peers. The biggest struggle for me thus far has been timeboxing. This is solely because of my thinking style; I am a perfectionist at heart and that has forced me to spend way too much time on certain challenges. I am constantly thinking about how I can make things even better, so I end up spending five hours on challanges that only require a minimum viable product. In order to use my time better, I am going to start by dividing the challenge into major parts/requirements and use the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730">Pomodoro Technique</a> to complete each major part. Once I am done with all of the weeks challenges, I can go back to tinker and perfect anything I want, if I have time to spare.
				<br>
				<br>
				In the past few weeks at DBC, I feel that I have already started to transform my mindset into a <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">growth-mindset</a>. I have been taking every challenge, pairing session, and reflection as a learning experience. I have been learning from my mistakes, my peers, and a lot from myself. This is the first time I have been excited to tackle "homework assignments" and I have absorbed more material in these 3 weeks than I probably could have in an entire quarter of college. I attribute this entirely to getting myself in the right positive mindset. The amazing part about changing my gears into a growth-mindset, is that I can assess what I need to work on, and in turn I can continue to grow day by day.
