				<h3>Pairing and Feedback</h3>
				<h4>by Randy Grewal on November 30, 2014</h4>

				<div id="bodyp"><p>One of the main reasons I decided to join DBC was the culture and I feel that pairing is a huge part of that culture. I have taken several free online courses and the main thing that they were lacking was guidance and people to help you. When I would hit a dead end, knowing that I had no one I could really ask for help was a disheartening experience, it just makes you feel that you aren't cut out for coding. In DBC so far, I have had an awesome exerience pairing on challenges. Knowing that you have a group of peers and guides to help you has made my learning experience that much more effective. Every pairing session I have learned so many new things, new ways to code, and overall just having peer interactions makes learning that much more fun. Even though the work is completely remote, I feel really involved and invested in the program. Pairing is a learning and teaching experience. Each time I have paired up, I try to pass off something new I have learned and that also helps reinforce the topic, so that you don't forget about it.
				<br>

				Feedback is another huge part of the DBC culture that I love. Feedback is a sort of progress report, and personally, I have always liked to have some sort of idea where I stand. Whether the feedback is about what subject I am slacking on in school or what level I am on in a video game, it is always helpful. It is nice to know what I need to work on, I have always been good about taking suggestions. In one of my feedback comments, my peer told me that I should check out a specific chapter in a book and when I did I was grateful, I understood classes that much more. Even if the feedback is something about me personally, I am all about constant self improvement, I want to continue to grow in every aspect and become a better person, so it is awesome to know what I should work on. I think the main thing I need to work on is the feedback I am giving people. I am very laid back and easy to work with, so its hard for me to really recognize faults with people, but I just need to make sure my feedback is more actionable. My feedback is always kind and specific, but I need to take a step back to analyze the more actionable things my peer could work on. Overall, pairing and feedback are very important to a succesfull future in any career path, so they are great tools to get used to and improve on right now.
