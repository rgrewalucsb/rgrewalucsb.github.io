After watching Shareef's Fireside Chat, my take on the Dev Bootcamp experience is that it is a very positive and constructive learning environment. DBC does not only teach you code, but also teaches you the correct growth mindset so that you can absorb the material quickly and also become a better person along the way.

DBC creates an evironment where, for once, it is okay to be wrong. They aim to give you a mindset where you can give and recieve constructive feedback which is immensely valuable in any future work environment. Everyday I have found a new thing I enjoy about DBC. They do not aim to simply toss a couple coding languages at me and send me on my way. Instead, the goal is much broader: they want to give me the proper framework and tools so that I can continue to learn new programs and skills throughout the rest of my career. 

I am extremely excited to take part in the DBC environment because the continue to exceed my expections. When I previously attempted to learn code on my own, I was constantly nervous because I was always unsure of myself and I would find myself at a dead end quite often. The fact that I have a group of peers, instructors, and resources that I can bounce questions off of makes me quite comfortable because I know that no matter what happens I will always have someone to turn to. 

I am looking forward to see where the DBC experience takes me and I am eager to become a better person and hopefully a decent programmer.
