				<h3>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h3>
				<h4>by Randy Grewal on December 14, 2014</h4>

				<div id="bodyp"><p>Helping others is important to me because everytime I have helped someone, I have felt happy, proud and satisfied all at the same time and through a selfless act. The first time I realized it was important to me was when I was doing community service at a homeless shelter. The gratitude I got from helping people in need made me feel awesome. Ever since then, whenever someone asks for my help, I do what I can whether they are my friends, family, or even someone I don't know. If I know I can help someone and I don't, it bothers me down the road and I regret it. Just having that in my conscience is a reaffirmation that I should always at least try to help people.
				<br>
				<br>
				The last topic someone asked me for advice on was: "What should I do with my life?" My younger cousin is getting ready to go to college so he wanted to know my opinion on it, after the four years I spent at UCSB. I told him at first I was worried about my career, I was worried about getting into a field with good pay, but thinking back all my thoughts were kind of superficial. After four years I realized I should have just done something I am interested in and I am good at, the rest will come by itself because of your motivation in the subject matter. I told him that you should do what makes you happy, something you wouldn't mind doing for the next 30 or so years.
				<br>
				<br>
				My values have made me into the person I am and I am happy I was raised with those values because without them I would be lost. If I ever recognize that I feel stereotype threat I think my values can help a little to mediate it, but I also think it is very hard to mediate. We have been raised in a society where it exists throughtout the system and most people are completely ignorant to it if they have not directly felt the effects of it. Personally, over the years I have pushed myself to become a positive person. Holding on to the negative things in life too long only holds you down. Similarly, I would just try not to think about stereotype threat because it is all mental. Whenever I am feeling down, what works for me is to take a couple deep breaths and think about why I am doing DBC, what are my goals in life, and who am I doing this for. Just thinking about things beyond myself always helps me pick myself up!
