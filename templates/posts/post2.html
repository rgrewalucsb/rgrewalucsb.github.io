      <p>In the past week, through my struggles of getting my website to look exactly how I want it to, I have learned a lot about HTML and CSS. In the first couple days, I found myself quite frustrated; I would finally get one thing to work and then something else would go wrong. At one point I just scrapped everything and decided to start over, but this time around, I would make my HTML a lot more CSS friendly. I looked at various websites and noticed their HTML was filled with classes and IDs. As for naming the classes and IDs I realized that the names were based on the function of that specific element. So, as I was typing the HTML this time around, I was very specific with my classes and IDs. I was also visualizing my end goal along the way so I knew exactly what elements should be the same class and which once need to be a specific ID. When it was done, the CSS was much easier and my website came together almost exactly how I imagined.

      The way I coded my HTML my last time around worked really well for me and I intend to follow the same formula every time. The key to keeping yourself from pulling all your hair out when designing your website is organization. When creating your webpage I recommend first visualizing all the separate elements of your page, their location and their function. So for example, a navigation bar on the top right or a fixed sidebar on the bottom right that shows your blog posted in order. Next I would outline all your divs, tables, paragraphs, etc. on the HTML page; no content necessary, just the branches. This way you can figure out if you need two divs within another div and so forth. It is much easier to plan this out if you have just the branches and no clutter. Once all your major branches are created, go through and create IDs/classes. I like to have control of each element, so I used a lot more IDs. I did not create a class for an element unless I knew for sure that more than one element are going to have the exact same function. Once all the naming was done, I typed out all of the classes and IDs into my CSS file as selectors, so that they were in order and ready to go. This is when I finally went back in and typed in all of the HTML into the branches. Since the outline was already done, and the function of each element was already written as a class/ID, I had no guesswork and typing in all the HTML was a breeze. The CSS part was even easier; another benefit is that if I want to edit the layout of anything in the future, I know exactly what I am changing, just from looking at my CSS document on DevTools.
