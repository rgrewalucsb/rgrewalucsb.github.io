      <p> Ruby is a Object-oriented programming language. Classes are a great example of of this object oriented design. When thinking about designing a Class, the objects it is going to represent usually have a similar purpose. The objects you plan to create with the Class will usually hold similar information, through variables, or accomplish a similar task, through methods. For holding information, Classes use instance variables, which basically represent an object's data or unique values.

      The best way to understand Classes, from my personal learning experience, is through examples. Frequently referring to the image above, I am going to walk you through creating a Class for my objects, movies. For now, ignore the attr_reader, attr_writer, and attr_accessor, I will come back to that later. So to create the Movie Class, I am going to first define the initialize; this is exactly  what it sounds like, this is what is initialized when a new class is created. My initialize is going to take one argument, the title, because every movie object you create is definitely going to have a title. So, for example, I would initialize an new Movie class later on like so: django = Movie.new("Django"). As you can see here and above in the image, everytime I initialize a new object of the Movie class, I would store it in a new variable, like I did for django.

      Next, I want the class to also have the option to hold two other variables, the director and the rating. To do this, I first created instance variables of them and then I set them to a default value if they are left unchanged. These variables, however, are not initialized with the new class. You may ask, then how do you change or access the director or rating? Well that is where the attr_reader(read), attr_writer(write), and attr_accessor(both read and write) come in handy. Attr lets you either read, write, or both read and write variables outside of the class. Above you may notice I added :director under attr_reader and attr_writer; this is the exact same thing as putting :director under attr_accessor as I did for :rating. After adding the attr's, now I can view the title outside the class by simply typing inglourious_basterds.title . I can do the the same with director and rating, but in addition I can also change them by typing inglorious_basterds.director = "Quentin Tarantino".

      Lastly, I created a movie_info method. This is a very simply method that displays the movie info in a sentence through puts. Refering to the same line, you can also take note of how I refer to the variables in the method. There are many ways to do similar tasks in Ruby, so I can do something similar to the movie_info method outside of the class, as I did for scarface. You get a great feel of this by comparing how inglourious_basterds.movie_info is different from puts "#{scarface.title} was ..." yet the output comes out to the same thing.
