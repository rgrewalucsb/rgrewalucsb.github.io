      <p> As technology is becoming more and more advanced, consumer privacy has become almost nonexistent. Even the most seeminly harmless devices now come equipped with geolocation tracking services, including cameras, smartphones, and even fitness watches. Tech giants like Facebook and Google are even known to collect data such as browsing history, location, and so forth to give users "customized ads". Don't get me wrong, I love seeing information relative to my likings, but the fact that this information is stored and it can be hacked into is not the most comforting feeling. The devices we own nowadays upload a lot more data, that most would care to share with the public. When posting a status or uploading an image, most Americans are unknowingly posting their location, which could very well be their exact address. On top of that, we have been hearing that many tech giants have turned over their data to the NSA. At that point, where do they draw the line? Could someone purchase my information from these companies for the right price? Am I going to start getting mail specific to what I have been searching on the web for the past few weeks?

      These are questions anyone could ask, which explains why a large portion of consumers have lost there confidence in tech companies. I love everything about technology, but not being able to trust it is a huge turn off. I have nothing to hide from the NSA, I am more worried about this information getting into the wrong hands. Since many tech companies share there data with other companies through marketing partnerships, what security measures do they have to prevent a data breach. Even a huge company like Home Depot was had a major data breach a couple months back. I think the best way to remedy the situation is for all tech companies that store any personal data should be more forthcoming with the consumer. If they are going to partner up with other companies, they should make sure that their data security standards are up to par. If tech companies start to be straight forward with customers and work with them to protect their privacy, it will be more beneficial for both in the long run.
