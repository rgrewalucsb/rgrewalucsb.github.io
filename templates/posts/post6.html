      <p>Object-Oriented (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP) are two different schools of thought for building the structure and elements of code. Simply put OOP focuses more on creating new objects and increasing the scope of old ones by adding new methods to them. For FP, on the other hand, the main focus is not the data structure, but instead implementing functions and performing different operations. Both of these design structures are very useful, the programmer picks either depending on the outcome he/she is looking for. Most people think of Ruby as just a OOP language, however it has elements of OOP and FP, so that you can use them hand in hand or seperately.

      In Functional Programming, programmers avoid state and mutable data, which allows it to have a much cleaner code. In OOP, you tend to frequently overwrite the variables, which makes the code hard to debug at times and it also leaves a lot of room for error. In the FP approach, you do not overwrite old functions and you continue to create new ones so that the functions stay isolated. Michael Feathers put it best in his quote, "OO makes code understandable by encapsulating moving parts.  FP makes code understandable by minimizing moving parts." Basically, OOP you have to continually define new methods and create objects, so as a result you are left with a lot of moving parts. Since you have many moving parts the code is more easily broken and takes more time to execute. FP on the other hand approaches code on a "as needed" basis, so it focuses more on the function and has lazy evaluations, which evaluates code by need. Both FP and OOP are great approaches to coding, but well constructed code will use the best programming paradigm for each case.
