      <p>Stereotype threat is being in a situation where a negative stereotype about your identity can be applied to you. Personally I have felt a stereotype threat in a couple very different situations. When I was young, I loved watching basketball, I grew up watching Michael Jordan. When it came to my first tryout, I was very intimadated by the other players and a lot of it had to do with the fact that I was trying out again mainly white and black kids. I had never see someone of Asian or Indian descent play in the NBA so I naturally assumed we are not that good. That coupled with the fact that kids 50 kids are  trying out and more than half have to get cut from the team, made me very nervous. Even later on in highschool I played basketball because I am 6'3 so my height is an advantage for basketball. Even though I was pretty good after playing for several years, that nervous feeling never went away, I always found myself folding under pressure when we were playing really good teams.

      On the other end of the spectrum, people of Indian or Asian descent tend to be good at math, science etc. I found myself excelling in math/science classes with minimal effort. A lot of this had to do with the fact that math and science are my favorite subjects, but compared to other subjects, I feel a lot more confident and decisive during math and science tests. But this makes me wonder if I am good at math and science because of the confidence the positive stereotype instilled in me. After going to a pretty diverse college and having a very diverse group of friends, I have seen stereotype threat, but I have also learned that you can work to get past the threat. Personally, I think optimism is a great start for evading this stereotype threat. When going into a test or any situation, I think positivity helps you keep a clear mind. I have gotten into my own head for a test and that was honestly the worst feeling in the world. You can try to pass blame on your situation or a stereotype, but the best thing to do is to accept it, figure out what you can improve on, and focus on that, as oppose to beating yourself up over it. Ever since, I always go in and leave knowing that I did my best, I studied to the best of my ability, and it has nothing to do with my social identity.

      When giving people feedback, this is why we use the ASK model. It allows us to focus on the things we can change, not things based on our social identity. I treat others how I would want to be treated. We are all different, we have our strength and weakness, but we are all in common because we want to improve ourselves as people and programmers. Everyone should always get a fair chance, no matter what stereotypes exist. We need to forget about static stereotypes and instead focus on learning from each other.
