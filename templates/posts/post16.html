      <p> The most recent emotional conflict I have had was with my mom. Throughout college I was independent and was living for one only myself to the point where I got really comfortable. Upon graduation, this lead me to immediately pursue a job away from home in LA so that I can continue to be independent and not be a burden to my parents. After three months of working hard hours in sales my mom pleaded my to come home to help out around the house, be rent free, as well as further my education so I don't have to work hard hours to make very little. I finally agreed and came back home, but every day I seemed to be frustrated at everyone, including myself. I ended up getting into an argument with my mom about the entire situation and then after thinking about it for a while I realized I was blaming the wrong people. I got too comfortable with being independent to the point where change was making me feel frustrated. My parents are supporting me to further my education and only want the best for me. How can I blame them? I realized I was being selfish; I should be more grateful that they showed the initiative to help me to better my life and actually pursue a career I would enjoy. Upon this realization, I found myself become more happy, close and grateful of my family and all the frustration and anger had gone away. The next time around when dealing with a conflict, thinking through the source of the conflict will help me avoid unnecessary stress and, as a result, find a much more reasonable solution for the problem.
