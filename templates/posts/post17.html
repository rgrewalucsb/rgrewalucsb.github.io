      <p>Asking a good question starts with trying your hardest to solve it yourself beforehand, through perusing a variety of resources such as stack overflow. More than likely, some version of your question has been ask before. Sometimes you need to check several different resources because you might only find bits and pieces of the answer you are looking for. This process helps you learn new things along the way. This way you at least try you best to tackle it on your own and are prepared to list different ways you have tried to solve it. If you cannot find a single thing on the question, then it is probably already a great question to ask, because other might be wondering the same thing.
      More than often you have everything working, and it might just be one tiny mistake. As a result, research will allow you to compare and contrast so you can make sure it is not, what we later refer to as a stupid mistake.

      Personally, when I get around to actually asking a question, it is after struggling on something for at least an hour. I am a little stubborn and I try to make sure I gave it my all before I ask. What I believe characterizes a good question is that it is phrased in a matter that emphasizes the main issue, without overlooking the sources of the issue. Your goal should also be addressed in a very specific manner as well as all of the difference solutions you have tried through researching the question. When you ask a vague question, you are going to get vague answers. You can usually get vague answers through a simple google search so specificity is a key aspect. This means you need to include the scenario in which you are addressing the problem, a screen shot of your issue, code, etc., and also include the errors you are getting. After getting an answer, do not get ahead of yourself, make sure you understand the solution completely and feel free to ask for further clarification of what you were doing wrong.
