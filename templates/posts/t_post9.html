      <p>Throughout phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp I continued to tinker and improve my website, mainly because I am a little OCD and I wanted to get it just right. I explored many websites and I picked up quite a few cool HTML/CSS tricks along the way, such as the after selector to make my links have a clickable area like a button. From the start, I tried to make my website look neat and easily maneuverable and by week 9 I loved the way it looked. Sticking to my maintenance schedule had a lot to do with getting my website this way. This wasn't the first time I asked for feedback on my website, so I had already integrated a lot of the ideas that I had gotten from my peers. For anyone thinking about creating their own website, I highly recommend googling some personal websites to get some ideas before actually coding your HTML. Creating your own webpage is probably one of the best ways to learn HTML and CSS. After a total of about 40 hours (not in one sitting) of trial and error, I have a solid understanding of HTML/CSS, which is a great skill to have.

      This week I decided to finally give my website its own Domain Name. Right when I started DBC I was tinkering around on GitHub and I stumbled upon a free <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">student developer pack</a> offered by GitHub Education. It came with a wide array of tools including my own Domain Name through Name through <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/"> Namecheap</a>, free for the first year. I ended up with a solid domain name, rgrewal.me, and now I just need to figure out how to get it working and link it to my github website. I found a solid article by David Densinger for <a href="http://davidensinger.com/2013/03/setting-the-dns-for-github-pages-on-namecheap/">Setting the DNS for GitHub Pages on Namecheap</a>. Within an hour I had got it working and now I have a great professional website, complete with my resume, some projects, my contact information, and quite a few blog posts. If you have any questions on how I created an of the elements on my website feel free to get in touch with me!
