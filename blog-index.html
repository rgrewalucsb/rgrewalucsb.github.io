				<h3>DBC Phase 0 Blogs: GitBlog</h3>
				<h4>October 29, 2014</h4>
				<hr>
				<p>GitHub and git is a version control software, or VCS. It allows programmers to track changes to a file collaboratively. Git allows for programmers to work on files locally and GitHub is the cloud that stores the master file. This way, if you are working with a team, you can work on a file without interfering with each other on your local machine and then push the changes to the cloud (GitHub) once you all agree that it is correct.
				<br>
				<br>
				When you are working on your local machine (git), it only effects your specific version. If something goes wrong, like something is deleted or incorrectly added, you can go back to GitHub and see exactly what went wrong. Git also requires you to add and then commit any changes you have made, this way you are forced to double check before you decide to lock in any changes.
				<br>
				<br>
				GitHub is especially useful to store your code. In case a file goes missing or God forbid, your computer completely crashes, you will always, essentially, have it backed up to GitHub. For a team of programmers working from different parts of the world, it is also extremely useful because you can do your end of the work from git and then merge each others contributions into one. While merging, GitHub also allows you to track each others' changes and if there are any conflicts, and then the team of programmers can communicate and figure out the best version.

				<h3>DBC Phase 0 Blogs: Cultural Blog</h3>
				<h4>October 29, 2014</h4>
				<hr>
				<p>After watching Shareef's Fireside Chat, my take on the Dev Bootcamp experience is that it is a very positive and constructive learning environment. DBC does not only teach you code, but also teaches you the correct growth mindset so that you can absorb the material quickly and also become a better person along the way.
				<br>
				<br>
				DBC creates an evironment where, for once, it is okay to be wrong. They aim to give you a mindset where you can give and recieve constructive feedback, which is immensely valuable in any future work environment. Everyday, I have found a new thing I enjoy about DBC. They do not aim to simply toss a couple coding languages at me and send me on my way. Instead, the goal is much broader: they want to give me the proper framework and tools so that I can continue to learn new programs and skills throughout the rest of my career. 
				<br>
				<br>
				I am extremely excited to take part in the DBC environment because they continue to exceed my expections. When I previously attempted to learn code on my own, I was constantly nervous because I was always unsure of myself and I would find myself at a dead end quite often. The fact that I have a group of peers, instructors, and resources that I can bounce questions off of makes me quite comfortable, because I know that no matter what happens, I will always have someone to turn to. 
				<br>
				<br>
				I am looking forward to see where the DBC experience takes me and I am eager to become a better person and hopefully a decent programmer.

				<h3>DBC Phase 0 Blogs: Best CSS Practices for Classes and IDs</h3>
				<h4>November 9, 2014</h4>
				<hr>
				<p>In the past week, through my struggles of getting my website to look exactly how I want it to, I have learned a lot about HTML and CSS. In the first couple days, I found myself quite frustrated; I would finally get one thing to work and then something else would go wrong. At one point I just scrapped everything and decided to start over, but this time around, I would make my HTML a lot more CSS friendly. I looked at various websites and noticed their HTML was filled with classes and IDs. As for naming the classes and IDs I realized that the names were based on the function of that specific element. So, as I was typing the HTML this time around, I was very specific with my classes and IDs. I was also visualizing my end goal along the way so I knew exactly what elements should be the same class and which once need to be a specific ID. When it was done, the CSS was much easier and my website came together almost exactly how I imagined.
				<br>
				<br>
				The way I coded my HTML my last time around worked really well for me and I intend to follow the same formula every time. The key to keeping yourself from pulling all your hair out when designing your website is organization. When creating your webpage I recommend first visualizing all the separate elements of your page, their location and their function. So for example, a navigation bar on the top right or a fixed sidebar on the bottom right that shows your blog posted in order. Next I would outline all your divs, tables, paragraphs, etc. on the HTML page; no content necessary, just the branches. This way you can figure out if you need two divs within another div and so forth. It is much easier to plan this out if you have just the branches and no clutter. Once all your major branches are created, go through and create IDs/classes. I like to have control of each element, so I used a lot more IDs. I did not create a class for an element unless I knew for sure that more than one element are going to have the exact same function. Once all the naming was done, I typed out all of the classes and IDs into my CSS file as selectors, so that they were in order and ready to go. This is when I finally went back in and typed in all of the HTML into the branches. Since the outline was already done, and the function of each element was already written as a class/ID, I had no guesswork and typing in all the HTML was a breeze. The CSS part was even easier; another benefit is that if I want to edit the layout of anything in the future, I know exactly what I am changing, just from looking at my CSS document on DevTools.
